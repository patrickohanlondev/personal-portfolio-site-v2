# Second draft of my personal portfolio site
This is an updated version of my personal portfolio. I recreated it from the ground up. The original code had a few band-aid fixes that I've learned to avoid through further study since. I've also added a lot more semantic HTML elements in place of generic divs.

## What did I learn on this project

The main goal of this second version was to ensure the site works across a all devices including mobile. I learned to begin the design process with mobile first in mind as most people today are likely to view the site on mobile. This is the first time I have started to use the '@media' rule. This rule wasn't as daunting as I originally though, as long as I kept my elements simple and easily manipulated. Already I feel that the next site I create using responsive design will benefit from what I learned during this project.
